# dotfiles

## Installation

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetpackjarrett/dotfiles/master/install.sh)
```

*Note:* ~/.dotfiles is HARD-CODED as the location of which to symlink, the setup scripts will break if you check out the repo to any other location.

## Usage

Link just dotfiles
```bash
sh setup/dotfiles.sh
```

Feel free to fork and use however you want. Several portions are probably only usable if you are an OSX user. Probably also want to change gitconfig in your fork to your information.
